<p>1. In Remote Desktop, connect to the Windows VM using the public IP address found in Microsoft Azure. Use your VM login details to connect. After connection to the VM, open a browser window and go to <a href="http://localhost/osTicket/">http://localhost/osTicket/</a>. This is the end users osTicket URL.
